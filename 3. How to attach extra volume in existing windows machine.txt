 10. Click on Next and in the storage section click on "ADD VOLUME" and make selections (size, vol type) of your desired choice and if you want to assign some tags then
Key:Name and Value:Webserver and click next.
 11. Create a Security group and 
        ---> assign its name
        ---> if you want you can add some rules like HTTP or HTTPS else RDP(by default) is OK.
        ---> change source to "anywhere".
        ---> click on "Review and Launch"
 12. Now a portal of key pair will be pop-up
        ---> click on "Create a new key pair" assign its name
        ---> click on download keypair and then launch instance and then view instances.
        ---> wait for a while till "Status Checks" opt shows 2/2 until just copy the IPv4 PUBLIC IP.
 13. Click on Connect option.
        ---> Download Remote Desktop File
        ---> click on get password
        ---> choose file(key pair) which we created in step12 and then click on decrypt password and copy it too.

        ---> go to disks >> check for disks status (if they are showing online then good else right click and online opt)
        ---> go to my comp >> check for another disk you created
        ---> **If it is not showing the other disk then go to server manager >> file storage >> disks >> vol section >> select disk opt and do the further proceedings and then again check in my comp after refreshing.
 16. Deleting server and volume (never forget this step)
